# Adapter length visualization

The output of the visualization can be found at `results/trimming.pdf`.

As of now, only adapter lengths for the selected libraries were extracted and plotted. The source file for these libraries can be found at `data/trimming.tsv`. The format of the adapter file for the plot is: `length\tsample1\tsample2\tsample3` where the samples columns contain number of trimmed adapters as reported by Cutadapt.
