# Poly(A) tail length
**Note:** This analysis can be done only if you ran Nanopolish poly(A) estimates during the sample preparation (`samples` directory).

Poly(A) tail visualization for **multiple combined** libraries where we compare only poly(A) length of reads **with poly(A) tail** can be found at `results/polya_length_nozero.pdf`.

For results from individual libraries, please see results at `results/library-name/polya_length_nozero.pdf`.

`library-name` is a placeholder for individual libraries names. 

Alternative for comparison of all reads **regardless on the presence of poly(A) tail** can be found at `results/polya_length_all.pdf`, and `results/library-name/polya_length_all.pdf`.
