# Meta-coordinates and poly(A) tail length correlation
**Important:** This analysis can be only run after **metacoord_correction** and **polya** analyses are finished!

## Degradation and poly(A) tail - transcripts
Relation between mapped reads ends distribtution and poly(A) tail can be found at `results/library-name/coords-on-corrected-meta-mrnas.unambig.rel5-inclLen-inclPolya-transcript-heatmap-polya.pdf`.

`library-name` is a placeholder for individual libraries names.

## Degradation and poly(A) length correlation - summary
Correlation between degradation and poly(A) tail length for reads **averaged to transcripts** can be found at `results/hsa.dRNASeq.HeLa.polyA.REL5.long.1/coords-on-corrected-meta-mrnas.unambig.rel5-inclLen-inclPolya-polya-vs-degrad.transcripts.pdf`, and for **individual molecules** can be found at `results/hsa.dRNASeq.HeLa.polyA.REL5.long.1/coords-on-corrected-meta-mrnas.unambig.rel5-inclLen-inclPolya-polya-vs-degrad.reads.pdf`.
