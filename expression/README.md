# Expression correlation
Visualization of the transcript expression correlation between the TERA-Seq libraries used in the manuscript can be found in `results/quant.allExp.samples_correlation-pearson.pdf`.

Alternative using spearman correlaction (`results/quant.allExp.samples_correlation-spearman.pdf`) as well as individual libraries pairs for both TERA5 (`results/quant.allExp.samples_pairs-REL5.png`) and TERA3 libraries (`results/quant.allExp.samples_pairs-REL3.png`) is provided.
