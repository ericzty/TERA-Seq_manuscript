# Change in completness of mRNA and CDS after re-annotation
**Important** This analysis can be only run after **metacoord_correction** analysis is finished!

## Heatmap
The heatmap figures used in the manuscript can be found at:
* `results/hsa.dRNASeq.HeLa.polyA.CIP.decap.REL5.long.1/rel-pos-5p-5p-zscore-heatmap.mrna.rel5.uncorr-unambig.pdf` for the **default annotation**
* `results/hsa.dRNASeq.HeLa.polyA.CIP.decap.REL5.long.1/rel-pos-5p-5p-zscore-heatmap.mrna.rel5.corr-unambig.pdf` for the **corrected annotation**. 

Figures used in the manuscript can be found at the **first** page.

Alternative corrections and plots using *primary* alignments instead *unambigous* is available as well (look for *primary* instead of *unambig* in the file name).

## Correlation of mRNA and CDS completeness
Figures used in the manuscript can be found at:
* `results/hsa.dRNASeq.HeLa.polyA.CIP.decap.REL5.long.1/counts.uncorrected-mrna.unambig.rel5.pdf` for the **default annotation**
* `results/hsa.dRNASeq.HeLa.polyA.CIP.decap.REL5.long.1/counts.corrected-mrna.unambig.rel5.pdf` for the **corrected annotation**. 

Figures used in the manuscript can be found at the **fourth** page.

Alternative corrections and plots using *primary* alignments instead *unambigous* is available as well (look for *primary* instead of *unambig* in the file name).
