# CAGE and APA
## CAGE
Results summarizing distances of reads from **CAGE** signals used in the manuscript for reads **with adapter** and for control (random positions within transcripts) can be found at `results/library-name/5p-cage-upstream.w_adapter_vs_control.pdf`. For comparison of reads **with** and **without** adapter you can check `results/library-name/5p-cage-upstream.w_vs_wo_adapter.pdf`. Plots with *.500.pdf* suffix contain distribution of overlaps over **all upstream positions** with x-axis focused to last 500 nt upstream. 
The second page calculates **cummulative** percentages within the 10 nt window which were used in the manuscript. The first page shows *regular* percentages **per position**.

`library-name` is a placeholder for individual libraries names. 

## APA (Alternative Poly(A) signals)
Results summarizing distances of reads from **APA** signals used in the manuscript for reads **with adapter** and for control (random positions within transcripts) can be found at `results/library-name/3p-apa-upstream.w_adapter_vs_control.pdf`. For comparison of reads **with** and **without** adapter you can check `results/library-name/3p-apa-upstream.w_vs_wo_adapter.pdf`. Plots with *.500.pdf* suffix contain distribution of overlaps over **all upstream positions** with x-axis focused to last 500 nt upstream.
The second page calculates **cummulative** percentages within the 10 nt window which were used in the manuscript. The first page shows *regular* percentages **per position**.
