# CAGE and APA
## CAGE
Results summarizing distances of reads from **CAGE** signals used in the manuscript for reads **with adapter** and with 200 offset can be found at `results/library-name/5p-cage-upstream.wAdapter_vs_offset200-wAdapter.pdf`. For comparison of reads **with** and **without** adapter you can check `results/library-name/5p-cage-upstream.w_vs_woAdapter.pdf`.
The second page calculates **cummulative** percentages which were used in the manuscript. The first page shows *regular* percentages per position.

`library-name` is a placeholder for individual libraries names.
