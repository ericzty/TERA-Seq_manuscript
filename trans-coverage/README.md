# Transcript coverage - transcriptome & genome
**Important:** If you want to re-generate the selection of Cap-Poly(A) top transcripts you have to run **polya** analysis are finished!

## Transcriptome alignments
Individual coverage plots for the **transcriptome** alignments with CAGE (black), NET-CAGE (purple), and APA (blue) signals merged to a single PDF can be found at `results/library-name/trans/coverage-all.fantom5-netcage.pdf`.

`library-name` is a placeholder for individual libraries names.

### Comparison of TERA5 libraries
Coverage of the Cap-Poly(A) and 5P-Poly(A) libraries for the selected transcripts for the **transcriptome** alignments merged to a single PDF can be found at `results/trans/coverage-all-fantom5-netcage.pdf`.

## Genome alignments
Individual coverage plots for the **genome** alignments with CAGE (black) and NET-CAGE (purple) **without Illumina** alignments with highlighted poly(A) tail merged to a single PDF can be found at `results/library-name/genome/all-alignments.pdf`.

Individual coverage plots for the **genome** alignments with APA (blue) signals **with Illumina** alignments merged to a single PDF can be found at `results/library-name/genome/wIllumina/all-alignments.pdf`.

`library-name` is a placeholder for individual libraries names.

### Genome alignments
Coverage of the Cap-Poly(A) and 5P-Poly(A) libraries for the selected transcripts for the **genome** alignments merged to a single PDF can be found at `results/compare/genome/all-alignments.pdf`.
