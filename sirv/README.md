# SIRV expression distribution and alignment
## Expression
### Summarized expressions comparison
The **expression distribution** for the SIRV E2 samples (database libraries) can be found at `results/SIRV-unambig/molarity_vs_count.pdf`. An alternative plots with *primary* reads instead of *unambiguous* are provided at `results/SIRV-primary/molarity_vs_count.pdf`.

### Individual libraries expressions
Results for indivual libraries can be found at `results/library-name/unambig/molarity_vs_count.pdf`. An alternative plots with *primary* reads instead of *unambiguous* are provided at `results/library-name/primary/molarity_vs_count.pdf`.

## Alignment visualization
Alignments assigned to individual SIRVs used for visualizations in the manuscript (BAM format; our libraries) can be found at:
* `results/hsa.dRNASeq.SIRV.polyA.REL5.long.2/unambig/reassign/genome/w_wo_rel5/assign_read-to-trans.SIRVxxx.untrim.w_rel5.bam` for reads with 5TERA adapter
* `results/hsa.dRNASeq.SIRV.polyA.REL5.long.2/unambig/reassign/genome/w_wo_rel5/assign_read-to-trans.SIRVxxx.untrim.wo_rel5.bam` for reads without 5TERA adapter.

`library-name` is a placeholder for individual libraries names. `SIRVxxx` is a placeholder for individual SIRV transcripts names.
