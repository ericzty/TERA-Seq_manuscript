# SIRV expression distribution and alignment
## Expression
The **expression distribution** for the SIRV E2 samples (from database) can be found at `results/SIRV-unambig/molarity_vs_count.pdf`.

An alternative plots with *primary* reads instead of *unambiguous* are provided.

## Alignment visualization
Alignments assigned to individual SIRVs (in BAM format; our own data) can be found at `results/library-name/unambig/reassign/genome/w_wo_rel5/assign_read-to-trans.SIRVxxx.untrim.wo_rel5.bam` for reads with 5TERA adapter, or in `results/library-name/unambig/reassign/genome/w_wo_rel5/assign_read-to-trans.SIRVxxx.untrim.wo_rel5.bam` for reads without 5TERA adapter. *library-name* is a placeholder for library name. *SIRVxxx* is a placeholder for SIRV transcript name. These BAM files were used for visualization in IGV.
