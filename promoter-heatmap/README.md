# Promoter signal at 5' ends
Analysis of promoter-like sites (PLS) from ENCODE SCREEN around 5TERA 5' ends with and without the adapter. Figures used in the publication can be found in `results/library-name/heatmap.PLS.w_rel5.png` for heatmap of reads with adapter, `results/library-name/heatmap.PLS.w_rel5.png` for heatmap of reads without adapter, and `results/library-name/profile.PLS.w_wo_rel5.png` for profiles of both reads with and without adapter.

`library-name` is a placeholder for individual libraries names.
